# Hello_World

Hello all!

My name is Ethan and as of writing this I am starting my new career in tech! I have a degree in Music Education, but I hope to continue to develop my skills as a web developer, and maybe someday move towards firmware and hardware. 

I love cats, oranges, anime, and leg day.
